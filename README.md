# Jellystack

**Jellystack** is a fully containerized and automated media server stack using Docker Compose. It brings together powerful tools like Jellyfin, qBittorrent, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and Bazarr — with built-in support for I2P via i2pd for anonymous torrenting.

## Features

- **Jellyfin** – Media server for streaming movies and TV shows
- **qBittorrent** – Torrent client with Web UI on port `8888`
- **Sonarr** – Automatic TV show downloads and organization
- **Radarr** – Movie management and automation
- **Prowlarr** – Indexer manager for Sonarr and Radarr
- **Bazarr** – Subtitle downloader for your media library
- **i2pd** – I2P daemon used as a proxy for qBittorrent
